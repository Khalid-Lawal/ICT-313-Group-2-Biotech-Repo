# Biodiversity Assessment in Different Ecosystems

## Introduction
Biodiversity is critical for maintaining ecological balance. This project evaluates biodiversity across various ecosystems using statistical analysis with IBM SPSS. Key factors include species richness, environmental variables, and human impact.

## Dataset
The dataset includes parameters like:
- Ecosystem Type (e.g., Forest, Wetland)
- Species Richness
- Vegetation Cover (%)
- Average Temperature (°C)
- Human Population Density (people/km²), etc.

## Objectives
- Assess biodiversity metrics across different ecosystems.
- Analyze the impact of environmental and anthropogenic factors.

## Analysis Methods
We used IBM SPSS Statistics for:
- Descriptive Statistics
- Regression Analysis
- ANOVA

## Results
- Protected ecosystems showed higher species richness than urbanized areas.
- Temperature and vegetation cover were strong predictors of biodiversity.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of conservation and sustainable land use. Protected areas are vital for preserving biodiversity.
